### Find some inspiration!

Like the saying goes, you need to know where you've been to know where your going. If you find yourself tired of riding the same old routes or running the same old path, don't worry, you're not alone.

Bifurkate is a powerful visualization tool to analyze your past rides, runs, walks and hikes.

Why? Because everyone loves data! Also, I was tired of riding the same route again and again and I wanted to mess with the Strava API.

### Commands to run the project
